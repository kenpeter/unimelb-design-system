    h1 Environmental scientist Tim Flannery joins University of Melbourne

    p One of Australia’s most highly regarded environmental scientists, Professor Tim Flannery, will join the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute as a Professorial Fellow.

    p Professor Flannery said he was delighted to join the University in this role where he could further contribute to research and engagement on issues of sustainability and climate change.

    p “Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing human beings on the planet. I’m pleased to take up the appointment to continue to push frontiers and move forward in dealing with climate change,” said Professor Flannery.

    p “The research I am planning to undertake at the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute will focus on what is needed to renew and replenish the Earth’s ecosystem,” he said.

    p Professor Brendan Gleeson, Director of the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, said Professor Flannery’s appointment was an outstanding addition to the University community.

    p “Professor Flannery’s scientific and policy work on sustainability is world class. He is an invaluable source of clear ideas on how we can change direction before it’s too late. We are incredibly pleased to have him on board,” he said.

He was the Chief Commissioner of the Climate Commission before it was dismantled in 2013 and subsequently launched the Climate Council to ensure the continued provision of independent information on the science of climate change to the Australian public.
